## Problems

* ### **Problem  1**
    <blockquote>
    This problem consisted of solving an N-Queens situation using Genetic Algorithms. It shows the initial states of different parents. It was required to arrive to the First genereation these parents produce using Fitness Equations. This Fitness Equation consisted of how many conflicts a single parent have regarding the N-Queens Problem

* ### **Problem 2**
    <blockquote>
    <p> This was a Labrynth Problem where you had to find a way out the maze. The maze was represented in a graph and different type of Informed and Uninformed Searches were to be used to arrive to the solution. These Searches were to be implemented on python as well.</p>
