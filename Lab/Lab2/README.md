## Tasks

* ### **Task 1A**
    <blockquote>
    It was a simple task where you had to figure out the error in the code and correct it. The error was that the if statement was compareing "str" with "int" which python does not allow. A simple fix was to convert the x variable to an integer. 
    </blockquote>

        A calculator was to be formed to include basic functionalites (i.e +,-,/,*) by creating a class. Inheritence was to be used to introduce special functionalities (i.e pow, log, ln). No need for any user input.
        </blockquote>

## Extra Tasks


* ### **Prediction Game**
    <blockquote>
    <p> A predicition game was to be created which will be able to predict a name that a user has in their mind. A user is shown a matrix of letters starting from A - Z.
    
    User selects the row number which contains the 1st letter of the name that User has in their mind. Last step is repeated for the 2nd letter. This goes on

    After this, the user is shown another matrix which contains the rows that the user selected, but this time they are converted into coloumn. Same process is repeated that was done for the previous matrix. At the end the program shows the user the name that the user was thinking. </p>
