## Tasks

* ### Task 1A
        It was a simple task where you had to figure out the error in the code and correct it. The error was that the if statement was compareing "str" with "int" which python does not allow. A simple fix was to convert the x variable to an integer. 

* ### Task 1D
    #### **2**
        Simple converter application was to be created which can convert values between different measurement units. User is given a menu to select from and then recives an awnser based on his input
    #### **3**
        A calculator was to be formed to include basic functionalites (i.e +,-,/,*) by creating a class. Inheritence was to be used to introduce special functionalities (i.e pow, log, ln). No need for any user input.
    #### **4**
        Same task as part 3, instead a module is to be created which will contain basic functionalities. Which will then be imported into main application

## Extra Tasks

* ### Prediction Game
        A predicition game was to be created which will be able to predict a name that a user has in their mind. A user is shown a matrix of letters starting from A - Z. 

        User selects the row number which contains the 1st letter of the name that User has in their mind. Last step is repeated for the 2nd letter. This goes on until user has selected all the rows for all the letters in their name.

        After this, the user is shown another matrix which contains the rows that the user selected, but this time they are converted into coloumn. Same process is repeated that was done for the previous matrix. At the end the program shows the user the name that the user was thinking.
